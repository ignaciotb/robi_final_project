# Mobile Manipulation Project

Packages for the Assignment 5 of the course DD2410 "Introduction to Robotics".

## Install
You need g++ with c++11 to compile this repo.
Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS Melodic.
Clone this repository inside your catkin workspace, install the dependencies, build it and run it.
For these instructions, we'll assumed you have created a ws called catkin_ws. 
Run the following commands in a terminal:
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone "this_repo_link" "folder_name"
$ cd 
$ rosdep update
$ rosdep install --from-paths catkin_ws --ignore-src --rosdistro=$ROS_DISTRO -y
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make -DCATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING=0 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo

Add this line at the end of your .bashrc file:
export GAZEBO_MODEL_DATABASE_URI=http://models.gazebosim.org/

$ source .bashrc
$ source catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```
## Run
In order to run the system:
```
$ roslaunch robotics_project gazebo_project.launch
$ roslaunch robotics_project launch_project.launch
```
You should be able to visualize the system in both Rviz and Gazebo and then you're ready to start to work.
See the instructions for the project in Canvas.
